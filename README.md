You can get access to the datasets used on this workshop on this [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xx8jCt_JgYq5g1WDDvrr6nmHPqo9CWXb?usp=sharing). They are mostly stored in a format called `Geopackage`, which is a customized SQLite database you can manage with GIS software.
